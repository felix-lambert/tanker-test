## Tanker test

# Setup

```
npm install
```

Set `INTERFACE` to the address that the webpack server should listen on in webpack.config.js.

# Usage

```
npm start
```

This will start a webpack-dev-server with hot module reloading, babel transformation using stage0, and serve an in-memory bundle.js.
